We have a tentative significant distribution among race. Things too look into next:

* What is the distribution of race for force used? (we have this set up)
* What is the distribution of race for all stop and frisk?
* What is the distribution of race within the region? (we may need an external data set for this)

Consider using test statistic with binomial distribution as ref. (see prediction_logit.R)
